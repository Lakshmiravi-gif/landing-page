Responsive Landing Page

This project is a fully responsive single-page landing website developed using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
It is designed by closely following a Figma UI mockup, ensuring a clean, modern, and pixel-perfect user interface.

The design is implemented based on a Figma UI and includes 6 major sections of a modern landing page.
This website consists of six major sections, representing the essential components of a contemporary landing page such as the Hero banner, Services, Features, Testimonials, Pricing, and Footer section.
Each section is implemented as a separate <div> with unique IDs for navigation.

HTML - Structure of the page
CSS - Styling and layouts
Bootstrap - Responsive grid and navbar
